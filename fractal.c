/* The Mandelbrot set formula is
z = zÂ² + c		=>		z = (zreal * zreal) + (zimag * zimag) + complex constant
where	c = (x + y) * i		point of interest = (real + imaginary) * iterations.
For Mandelbrot, the parameter is the xy coordinates of the pixel, 
starting at -2, 2.
Values between 0 and 1 are within the set.
0 and 1 are fixed points. 0 is an attractive point, 1 is a repelling point.
After the first iteration, negative numbers become positive.
Values from -1 to 1 remain localised (within the set), and are traditionally
coloured black.
All other orbits (< -1 or > 1) shoot off towards infinity (outside the set),
so they are coloured based on how quickly they escaped.

Examples:
If c = 1, it heads towards infinity, so it's not part of the Mandelbrot set.
If c = 0.1, it loops in 0.11, so it is part of the Mandelbrot set.
If c = -1, it loops between -1 and 0, so it is part of the Mandelbrot set.
If c = -1.9, it gets a dynamic behaviour, but never leaves the local area.
Anytime the value of the orbit goes beyond an absolute two, it is guaranteed
to hit towards infinity.
All the positive values from 0 to 0.25 are part of the Mandelbrot set.
All the values < -2 are outside the Mandelbrot set.
